        Oh yeah, yeah yeah
        Now God said to Noah
        I don't want no sinnin'
        Oh yeah, yeah yeah
        I've been telling you this since 'In the beginnin'
        Oh yeah, yeah yeah
        You gotta round up your sons and all of their women
        Oh yeah, yeah yeah
        Because you're going on a big boat ride
        Now gather all the animals by the pair
        Build a big ship about a million square
        And put all the animals right in there
        And sail away on the tide

        But what if Noah
        Had just said "No sir"
        Well we'd all have fins and scaly skins
        We'd breathe through gills instead of nostrils
        And we'd eat fish food instead of vitamin pills
